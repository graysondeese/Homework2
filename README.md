This project required me to refactor some code. This was my first time doing something like this but I honestly enjoyed it.
***
I started out by adding alt attributes to the img tags.
Then I added a nice title for the page.
Then I went back and changed the div tags out for "better" tags.
To do this I used the HTML5 Element Flowchart.
